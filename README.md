In openerp 7.0 and sitll 8.0 you can access any view by manipulating URL even if the related menu is not available to you. This addon is my solution to this problem.

This is very naive and simple work around and it may has problems ( lazy me ;-) ). Please feel free to try it and send me your comments.
